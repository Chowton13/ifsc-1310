<h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p> Progressive Enhancement is web design based on building the website around the content that is being distributed instead of focusing on different browsers.
    I found the m&m analogy quite interesting and I completely agree that a webpage is just multiple layers stacked on top of each other that make it whole. 
    However, you could remove a layer or two and still have a functioning webpage. The more layers the developer adds, the better the page may look or function. 
    Not everyone that may visit the site may care about how fancy the site is developed, they just want it to be functional for their use.</p>
  <p> Progressive enhancement is important because without focusing on the content of the client, then the webiste is pretty useless in my opinion. 
    If the purpose of the site is to sell a certain product but the customer hass issues navigating the page or being able to locate what they are looking for, then the client is probably going to lose business. 
    When using progressive enhancement the web page will most likely be able to function on most browsers, especially with most people having their devices set to automatically update.

  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    Creating this website posed many challenges for me, some that I was expecting and some that caught me off guard. 
    I found that I needed to review many of the basic elements to make them function correctly. 
    This project makes you use every skill that was taught in class and research different ways to implement them to have a functioning and presentable webpage.</p>
    
    <p>I found myself having to play with certain elements and constantly check the preview to see what element I was manipulating. 
      I struggled the most with the CSS elements of the webpage. Mainly with positioning images and properly sizing them for the page.</p>
    
      <p>The feedback I received provided great insight and pointed out some key problems I was unaware of. 
        The major problem that was noticed, is when the user navigated away from the homepage, they were not able to return to it. 
        The link that had been set up did not function correctly and they would receive an error for page not found. I found that I had incorrectly labeled the pathway for the HTML tag. 
        The user also stated that the images on the page looked out of place and were too small. I was finally able to figure out how to position them correctly. </p>

    <p>I feel that I could have done much better this semester if I would have stayed caught up with each week's lectures. 
      I constantly found myself having to watch 2-3 lectures at a time. Which is a lot of information to absorb at once.
      I constantly felt like I was behind which caused a lot of anxiety with performing the tasks at hand.</p>
