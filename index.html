<h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p> Progressive Enhancement is web design based on building the website around the content that is being distributed instead of focusing on different browsers.
    I found the m&m analogy quite interesting and I completely agree that a webpage is just multiple layers stacked on top of each other that make it whole. 
    However, you could remove a layer or two and still have a functioning webpage. The more layers the developer adds, the better the page may look or function. 
    Not everyone that may visit the site may care about how fancy the site is developed, they just want it to be functional for their use.</p>
  <p> Progressive enhancement is important because without focusing on the content of the client, then the webiste is pretty useless in my opinion. 
    If the purpose of the site is to sell a certain product but the customer hass issues navigating the page or being able to locate what they are looking for, then the client is probably going to lose business. 
    When using progressive enhancement the web page will most likely be able to function on most browsers, especially with most people having their devices set to automatically update.
